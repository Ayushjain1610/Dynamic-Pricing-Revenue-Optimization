# Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to understand how price, seasonality, and promotions influence customer demand. Using analytics and economic modeling, the study identifies the revenue-maximizing price region and demonstrates how data can guide pricing strategy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Setting the right price is critical for maximizing revenue. However, historical transactional data often lacks sufficient price variation to directly estimate customer price sensitivity. This project addresses that challenge using demand modeling and elasticity-based pricing simulation.

## 🧠 Approach

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned transactional sales data  
- Engineered features such as month and weekend indicators  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed price-demand relationship  
- Identified seasonal demand patterns  
- Studied the impact of discounts on sales  

### Demand Modeling
- Built regression-based demand estimation framework  
- Evaluated model limitations due to low price variation  

### Elasticity-Based Simulation
- Applied economic price elasticity principles  
- Simulated customer response across price scenarios  

### Revenue Optimization
- Computed revenue for each simulated price  
- Identified revenue-maximizing price region  

### Visualization
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate insights

## 📊 Key Insights
- Historical data showed weak natural price elasticity  
- Demand varies by season  
- Discounts increase demand but must be strategically applied  
- A clear revenue-maximizing price region exists  
- Demand transitions from inelastic to elastic as price increases
